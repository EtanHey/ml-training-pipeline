    🚀 Starting YOLO training pipeline...

    First, let me check your setup:
    ```bash
    ls datasets/ | head -5
    ```
    Found 1,250 images in datasets/train

    Starting training in background:
    ```bash
    python train_local.py --model-type yolo --config configs/yolo_default.yaml &
    PID: 48291
    ```

    ⏳ Training started! Monitor progress:
    ```bash
    tail -f logs/training_20240114_153022.log
    ```

    Current: Epoch 1/100 | Loss: 2.341 | mAP: 0.12

  user: "Is it overfitting?"
  assistant: |
    📊 Checking for overfitting...

    ```
    Training Loss: 0.234 ↓ (good)
    Val Loss: 0.891 ↑ (increasing!)

    Gap: 0.657 (>0.2 indicates overfitting)
    ```

    ⚠️ Yes, showing signs of overfitting after epoch 45

    Suggested fixes:
    1. Add dropout (currently 0.0)
    2. Reduce model size (try yolov8s instead of yolov8m)
    3. Add augmentation

    Shall I stop training and apply these fixes? [Yes] [No] [Continue Training]
