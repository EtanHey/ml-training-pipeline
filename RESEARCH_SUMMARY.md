# ML Training Pipeline Research Summary

## Original Request
Analyze finetune-workshop repository and find TypeScript alternatives for model training, with comparison of Hugging Face vs RunPod deployment options.

## Key Findings

### 1. finetune-workshop Analysis
- **Purpose**: YOLOv8 hand detection classifier workshop
- **Workflow**: Video capture → Frame extraction → Training on RunPod → Local inference
- **Key Components**:
  - `capture_and_prepare.py`: Records videos, extracts ~300 frames
  - `live_demo.py`: Webcam inference with MPS acceleration
  - Training: Uses RunPod RTX A5000 (~$2/hr)
  - Dataset: Simple folder structure (train/val with class subdirs)

### 2. TypeScript/Browser ML Options

#### TensorFlow.js (Best for Training in Browser)
- ✅ **Full training support** in browser/Node.js
- ✅ Transfer learning and fine-tuning
- ✅ WebGL/WebGPU acceleration
- ✅ Strong TypeScript support
- ✅ Computer vision ready (webcam integration)
- 📦 Import existing TF/Keras models

#### Transformers.js (Inference Only)
- ✅ Run Hugging Face models in browser
- ❌ No training/fine-tuning support
- ✅ ONNX runtime for efficiency
- ✅ TypeScript definitions available
- 📦 Workflow: Train in Python → Convert to ONNX → Deploy

### 3. Deployment Cost Comparison

#### RunPod
**Pros:**
- 💰 **Serverless**: $0.00034/s (pay only when running)
- 💰 Millisecond billing
- 🚀 48% cold starts under 200ms
- 🎯 Spot pricing: 60-91% discount
- 🌍 30+ regions, wide GPU selection
- 🔧 Both training (Pods) and inference (Serverless)

**Pricing Examples:**
- RTX 4090: $0.34/hr
- A100 80GB: $2.17/hr
- H100 80GB: $1.99/hr

#### Hugging Face
**Pros:**
- 🔗 Seamless HF Hub integration
- 🎯 Managed infrastructure
- ⚡ Auto-scaling and scale-to-zero
- 🆓 Free Spaces tier available

**Pricing:**
- Inference Endpoints: From $0.50/GPU/hr
- PRO: $9/month (20x inference credits)
- Billed per minute

### 4. Recommendation

**For Your Use Case:**
1. **Training**: Use Python (not TypeScript) - better ecosystem
2. **Browser Inference**: TensorFlow.js for real-time
3. **Deployment**: RunPod Serverless for cost efficiency

**Hybrid Approach:**
```
Python Training → ONNX/TF.js Export → Browser/Serverless Deployment
```

### 5. Why RunPod Over Hugging Face

**Cost Efficiency:**
- Pay per millisecond vs per minute
- Zero cost when idle (serverless)
- Spot instances for training (60-91% savings)

**Flexibility:**
- Custom Docker containers
- Any framework support
- Persistent storage options
- Both training and inference

**Performance:**
- Sub-200ms cold starts
- Global edge locations
- Pre-warmed instances available

**When to Use HF Instead:**
- Already using HF ecosystem heavily
- Need managed solution with minimal DevOps
- Want integrated model versioning
- Building demos/prototypes (free Spaces)

## Next Steps

1. Set up modular training pipeline (Python)
2. Implement TensorFlow.js browser inference
3. Create RunPod serverless deployment configs
4. Add HF deployment as secondary option
5. Build automation scripts for both platforms
